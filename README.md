A pre-print of this manuscript is available via *PsyArXiv*, doi:[10.31234/osf.io/yfn56](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/yfn56)


Please note that the data included here is synthetic. It was generated using the **synthpop** package in **R**. This data matches the original in some aspects, but not all. Hence, running the code on the synthetic data will produce different results than those reported in the paper.

The above approach helps reproducibility, but is obviously limited. This precaution is warranted, as the data concerns a sensitive population (children), and contains data that cannot be anonymised (e.g. neighbourhood deprivation).

If you are hoping to access the original data, please contact Dr Edwin Dalmaijer.
